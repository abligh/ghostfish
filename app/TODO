TODO
====

* Look at the Id / Generation thing. Monotonic time? Lamport clock?

* Examine serialization of RpcAddress
* SendAsync to group
* SendAsync to Leader (with retry retrying it to the new leader)

* Hmmm change approach to the above so that it does not use a simple redirect as that can't remember the leader. We need aliases or something.

* Add WaitGroup for Mux shutdown

* Convert FSM Mutex to RWLock()

* Look at view of whether peers are up / down
* Web server
